# Note Taker
Creating a note taking app with express 

Will take notes and save them to be read later

It will be able to go to past saved notes and read them again later and
delete notes when they are no longer needed 


For users that need to keep track of a lot of information, it's easy to forget or be unable to recall something important. Being able to take persistent notes allows users to have written information available when needed.
